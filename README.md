# Connect4_Q
Tabular Q learning and Deep Q learning for Connect 4.

Connect 4 game engine and board was built from scratch using base python and object oriented coding framework.
Q learning algorithm was implemented to train an AI agent to play connect 4 against a random-action agent.

Deep Q learning, powered by a PyTorch implemented neural network with epsilon degredation for exploration vs. exploitation, was implemented and game trials were conducted with both self-play (two DeepQ agents) and play against a random agent.
